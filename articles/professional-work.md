# Amble

[Amble](https://github.com/Sawyer-Powell/Amble) is an omnitool for your data, allowing you to collect information from distinct sources into a unified format, and providing powerful interfaces to program, view and manipulate that information. Amble first aims to provide a plugin for Neovim that allows users to interact with their Amble data in Markdown and Org mode, making Amble a natural alternative to existing note taking/knowledge management systems. Amble then aims to provide a web framework that can allow users to create UIs for manipulating and viewing their data.

# Gleaners Drive & Dish

At Counterpart I'm currently developing a [web platform](https://pacersfoundation.org/drive-dish/) for Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana to help distribute food to over 10,000 households per week. This platform allows users to place online orders, and on demand drive-thru orders with food banks in the Midwest to receive free and heavily discounted food. This platform also powers the warehouse technology to meet this volume of requests, distributing and delivering food.

# ScholarTrack

[ScholarTrack](https://scholartrack.org) is the primary platform for students in Indiana to apply for, and receive, financial aid for Indiana universities and colleges. This platform was developed in-house by [Counterpart](https://www.counterpart.biz) for the Indiana Commission of Higher education in 2017. I joined the Counterpart team in 2022 as project manager for the ScholarTrack platform. I've worked with a team of excellent developers at Counterpart in implementing some landmark features, like CHE's pre-admissions and auto-enrollment programs, which are set to give tens of thousands of students in Indiana a leg up for getting into university. Each year our platform powers the distribution of [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.in.gov/che/files/2022_College_Costs_Report_03_23_22b.pdf) of financial aid for students across Indiana.

# CHEDSS

CHEDSS is the internal data analysis tool used by the Indiana Commission of Higher education to help them design policy around financial aid distribution. CHEDSS is used by the Indiana government, alongside Indiana universities, to coordinate data collection, analyze trends, and take action on college enrollment targets. I took over as technical lead for this project at [Counterpart](https://www.counterpart.biz) in 2022, where I spearheaded a full redesign of their system.

# ngx-natlang

[ngx-natlang](https://github.com/Sawyer-Powell/ngx-natlang) is a collection of open source tools I wrote, primarily for internal use at [Counterpart](https://www.counterpart.biz), to make it simple to write AI powered experiences in Angular (and AngularJS for some of our legacy projects). `ngx-natlang` builds upon the concept of AI `tools` and extends it to the concept of `actions`, which are pieces of logic that deeply integrate into the frontend of the application. Actions take structured input from the AI and feed that into a user defined functions. These functions can make http requests, render custom components to an AI chat window, manipulate arbitrary frontend components, or even create custom dialog trees the user can have with the AI. `actions` offer a convenient interface for programmers to exercise fine control over how a user interacts with an AI. `ngx-natlang` is currently being deployed in various projects at [Counterpart](https://www.counterpart.biz).
